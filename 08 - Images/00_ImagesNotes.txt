1) What are images in HTML?
- In HTML, images are elements used to display visual content, such as photographs,
  illustrations, icons, or logos, within a webpage.
- They are represented by the '<img>' tag.
- The <img> tag is a self-closing tag(unpaired) and an inline element.
- There are two attributes of <img> tag:
        1> src
        2> alt
        3> dimensions (width and height)

1> src
- The 'src' attribute is used to specify the URL(uniform resource locator) of the
  image file.
- This URL can be a relative or absolute path to the image file.
- Exameple:
    <!-- Displaying an image using an absolute URL -->
    <img src="https://www.example.com/image.jpg">

    <!-- Displaying an image using a relative URL -->
    <img src="image.jpg">


2> alt
- The 'alt' attribute provides the alternative text for the image, which is displayed
  if the image cannot be loaded or if the user is using a screen reader.
- it is essential for accessibility and SEO(Search engine optimization) purposes.
- Example:
    <img src="https://www.example.com/image.jpg" alt="Example Image">


3> dimensions (widght and heigth)
- This is used to specify the dimensions of the image using the 'width' and 'height'
  attributes.
- This can help browers allocate space for the image before it loads, preventing layout
  shifts.
- Example: 
    <!-- Providing dimensions for the image -->
    <img src="image.jpg" alt="Image with Dimensions" width="300" height="200">
